# Supermall iOS Interview Project

Welcome to the iOS interview project for Supermall!

### Your Task

At a high level, your task is to create an app that compresses, uploads and plays a video.

### Time
This project should take 4-6 hours to complete.

### Video
First, you're going to need the video. Please save this video to your iPhone's camera roll - https://test-videos.co.uk/vids/bigbuckbunny/mp4/h264/1080/Big_Buck_Bunny_1080_10s_30MB.mp4

### App
To pass the test, the app has to include the following:
* Load the video (Big Buck Bunny) from your iPhone's camera roll
* Compress the video to under 3MB without changing the resolution (1080p)
* Upload the compressed video to GCS, AWS or another cloud storage provider
* Once the upload is complete, display the video with a custom video player

### Bonus
If you're up for it, here are bonus tasks:
* Load all the videos from your camera roll into a collection view, sorted by most recent first
* Show upload progress while the video is uploading
* Add a model to support captions, hashtags and metadata on each video
* Add support for your video player to pause/play when the video is tapped
* Add a play icon overlaid on the video when the video is paused

## Requirements
* Use Swift 5.0 or above.
* No SwiftUI allowed.
* There should be no errors, warnings or crashes
* The app should compile and run. If it needs additional setup, include instructions in the README.

## Guidelines
* Keep your files short and sweet, use extensions and break out helpers when appropriate.
* Make sure the main functionality of the app is tested (or at least testable).
* It's important that the app follows a clear architecture pattern.
* Comment and document your code where appropriate.
* Feel free to use 3rd party libraries, but make sure to justify why you've used them in the README.
* Be consistent with your coding style. 
* Remove any unused or Apple-generated code

## Submission
